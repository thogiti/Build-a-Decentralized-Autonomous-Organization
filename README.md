# Build-a-Decentralized-Autonomous-Organization

What we will be building

Blockchain Congress

Blockchain Congress will be a decentrally controlled organization which will run on top on Ethereum Blockchain as a smart contract. This will have the below features:

1. There will be an admin who will work like a chairman, owner, CEO, president, MD etc.
2. Admin can add or remove the member of the congress by executing a smart contract
function.
3. Any member can add a proposal in form of an ethereum transaction.
4. All the members can vote in favor or against the proposal for a specific time
5. If the certain minimum number of members have voted and the deadline has passed the
contract will count the votes & if there are enough margin for the winner the proposal
will be marked as passed.
6. Once the proposal is passed, any member can execute it by calling the smart contract
function.
7. The above process can be repeated any number of times.

Shareholder Association

Shareholder association will be a democratically controlled organization which will run on top on Ethereum Blockchain as a smart contract. This will have the below features:

1. Organization’s ownership will be represented by a crypto token which will be a token created through a smart contract on top of Ethereum Blockchain.
2. Anybody can get the Association’s shares by investing the ethers into it. It’s like buying the share of the organization by paying in ethers.
3. Ownership will be represented by these shares.
4. Any new investment in the DAO will dilute the ownership of the existing members.
5. Taking over of the association can be avoided by issuing the equal amount of token to the
founder leading to founders always own more than 50% of the association.
6. In place of founder’s address this can be the Board address to make it democratic.
7. Any member can add a proposal in form of an ethereum transaction.
8. All the members can vote in favor or against the proposal for a specific time
9. After the deadline has passed, the contract will tally the votes giving 1 share = 1 vote as
the weight & if there are enough margin for the winner the proposal will be marked as
passed.
10. Bigger the shareholder the bigger his powers will be.
11. Once the proposal is passed, any member can execute it by calling the smart contract
function.
12. The above process can be repeated any number of times.
